## Overview
The **Ajira Digital Club of Kirinyaga University** presents the **Upskill Series**, an initiative designed to equip members and the wider community with industry-relevant skills. 

The first session in this series focuses on **Data Analysis with Python**, building on previous training in Excel-based data analysis. This hands-on training will guide participants through Python programming fundamentals, data manipulation, and visualization using key libraries like **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this training, participants will:
- Understand Python programming basics
- Work with data structures and control flow in Python
- Handle data files and perform basic data cleaning
- Use **NumPy** for numerical computations
- Use **Pandas** for data manipulation
- Create visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this training, you should:
- Have basic computer literacy
- Be familiar with spreadsheets (Excel/Google Sheets is a plus but not required)
- Have an eagerness to learn Python!

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### 1. Install Python
Download and install the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Install Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)
Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive coding environment:
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```
Run Jupyter Notebook with:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### 4. Verify Installation
Run the following command in Python to check installations:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
print("Setup Successful!")
```
